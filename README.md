### Hi there, bonjour 👋

I'm a creative, always playing with new explosive 💣 technologies and eager to get my hands on the new stuff. 

Always open for a chat about embedded systems, hardware design, IC fabrication, computer architectures, sound systems, DIY, graphics programming, or DIY :) 

Bonus point for those who like low-level programming!
