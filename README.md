### Hi there, bonjour, hallo ðŸ‘‹

I'm a creative, always playing with new explosive ðŸ’£ technologies and eager to get my hands on the new stuff. 

Always open for a chat about embedded systems, hardware design, IC fabrication, computer architectures, sound systems, DIY, graphics programming, or DIY :) 

Bonus point for those who like low-level programming reinvent the wheel for the 102910th time!
